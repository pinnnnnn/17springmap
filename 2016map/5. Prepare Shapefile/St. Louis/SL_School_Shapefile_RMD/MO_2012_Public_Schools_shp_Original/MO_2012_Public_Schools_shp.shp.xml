This layer currently includes public schools as provided by the Missouri Dept of Elementary and Secondary Education.</purpose><supplinf>Locations generated using Centrus Geocoder for ArcGIS from data provided by Missouri Dept of Elementary and Secondary Education from their web site (http://www.dese.mo.gov/directory/download.html) Quality Control by Geographic Resources Center (GRC) completed 10/13/2003 to adjust for false Geocoding results. (Geocoding points that were originally accurate to the ZIP code centroid.) PUBLIC SCHOOLS updated 5/2004. Locational updates provided by GEOGRAPHIC RESOURCE CENTER 6/24/2004 New schools for year 2004-2005 placed using Centrus Geocoder for ArcGIS. 5/9/2007 - schools closed since 2005-2006 were deleted. Schools new for 2006-2007 were added by geocoding addresses with Centrus Geocoder for ArcGIS. Enrollment for these new schools is "0" at the time of data layer creation. 4/7/2008 - new schools for 2007-2008 school year added. Several corrections to locations made to GRC work done in 2003. 3/31/2009 - new schools for 2008-2009 added, any closed schools removed. Locations of new schools photo identified if possible. 2/5/2010 - new schools for 2009-2010 added, any closed schools removed. Location of new schools photo identified if possible. NOTE: Charter schools, which had been previously stored as a separate layer for 2008-09 school year are now included in this public school layers. 10/2010: Data was field verified in the Southeast region of Missouri by staff in the SEMO and Bootheel Regional Planning Commission (RPC) offices, and corrections were added to this file by Missouri State Emergency Management Agency GIS staff. Data that has been field verified by these agencies has a value of "RPC" in the field "LocCode". 11/2011 New Schools were added, closed schools were removed. New schools were photo verified. Comments field added to allow for including information on schools damaged due to Joplin tornado. 09/2013 New Schools were added, closed schools were removed. New schools were photo verified. As several schools have went to a central address, physical addresses were provided for these schools (where different). </supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20130909</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Annually</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-95.522797</westbc><eastbc>-89.148059</eastbc><northbc>40.565597</northbc><southbc>36.019291</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>DESE</themekey><themekey>education</themekey><themekey>elementary</themekey><themekey>school</themekey><themekey>secondary</themekey><themekey>magnet schools</themekey><themekey>special education</themekey><themekey>schools</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt><themekey>society</themekey><themekey>structure</themekey></theme><place><placekt>None</placekt><placekey>Missouri</placekey><placekey>029</placekey><placekey>MO</placekey></place><temporal><tempkt>None</tempkt><tempkey>2012, 2013</tempkey></temporal></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>None</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Missouri Office of Geospatial Information</cntorg></cntorgp><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype><address>PO Box 570</address><address>301 West High Street, Room 840</address><city>Jefferson City</city><state>MO</state><postal>65102</postal><country>US</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>573-522-5034</cntvoice><cntemail>MO.GIS@oa.mo.gov</cntemail><hours>8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Monday - Friday (Central Time)</hours></cntinfo></ptcontac><datacred>Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. </datacred><native>Microsoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcGIS 10.0.4.4000</native></idinfo><dataqual><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>Matched to Missouri 1 meter Digital Ortho Quarter Quadrangles - 2004</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><procstep><procdesc>As a quality check, entire table is geocoded again.
