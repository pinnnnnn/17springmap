####0. Install Required Packages.
```{r,message=FALSE}
#"dplyr" package is used to do data cleaning and scraping  
if(!require(dplyr)) 
    install.packages("dplyr")
    require("dplyr")
#"RCurl" package is used to read raw data from github
if(!require(RCurl)) 
    install.packages("RCurl")
    require("RCurl")
```

####1. Reading Datasets.
First, I read all three datasets that we will use in the cleaning process, they are: (1) gender data, (2) employment data and (3) income data. These three datasets, regarding to several census attributes for New York City, are collected from 2010 census data from American Census Bureau.
```{r}
#Reading gender data
genderdataURL <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinnnnnn/MAP_Spring_2016/master/2010_NYC_Age_and_Sex.csv")
genderdata <- read.csv(text = genderdataURL, quote = "")
#Reading employment data
employmentdataURL <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinnnnnn/MAP_Spring_2016/master/2010_NYC_Employment_Data.csv")
employmentdata <- read.csv(text = employmentdataURL, quote = "")
#Reading income data
incomedataURL <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinnnnnn/MAP_Spring_2016/master/2010_NYC_Individual_Income.csv")
incomedata <- read.csv(text = incomedataURL, quote = "")
#Reading population data
populationURL <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinnnnnn/MAP_Spring_2016/master/2010_NYC_Population.csv")
populationdata <- read.csv(text = populationURL, quote = "")
```

####2. Process Gender Dataset
* I used 15 out of 871 variables used from the raw datasets:
    + 1. __GEO.id2__:        2010 census data geoid10 code by census tract  
    + 2. __SUBHD0101_S01__:  Total population  
    + 3. __SUBHD0102_S01__:  Total male population  
    + 4. __SUBHD0103_S01__:  Total femal population  
    + 5. __SUBHD0102_S20__:  Total male population 15 - 19 years

    + 15. __SUBHD0102_S124__:  Total male population 110 and above

```{r}
#Change the used columns into corresponding names
genderdata <- rename(genderdata, Geoid10 = GEO.id2, Totalpop = SUBHD0101_S01, Malepop = SUBHD0102_S01, Femalepop = SUBHD0103_S01)
#Sum up total male population from age 15 - 24
genderdata$Male1524 <- genderdata$SUBHD0102_S20 + genderdata$SUBHD0102_S26
#Sum up total male population above age 65
genderdata$Male65Plus <- genderdata$SUBHD0102_S80 + genderdata$SUBHD0102_S86 + genderdata$SUBHD0102_S92 + genderdata$SUBHD0102_S98 + genderdata$SUBHD0102_S104 + genderdata$SUBHD0102_S110 + genderdata$SUBHD0102_S116 + genderdata$SUBHD0102_S123 + genderdata$SUBHD0102_S124
#Only keep the columns needed
genderdata <- genderdata[c(2,4:6,872:873)]
```




####3. Process Population Dataset

```{r}
#Only keep the columns needed
employmentdata <- rename(employmentdata, Geoid10 = GEO.id2, Laborforce = HC02_EST_VC01, Unemploymentrate = HC04_EST_VC01)
#Assign unemployment rate within races, age, and poverty groups to new columns with corresponding names
employmentdata$HispanicUnemployed <- employmentdata$HC04_EST_VC21
employmentdata$WhiteUnemployed <- employmentdata$HC04_EST_VC22
employmentdata$HisWhiteUnemployed <- employmentdata$HC04_EST_VC13
employmentdata$HisBlackUnemployed <- employmentdata$HC04_EST_VC14
employmentdata$HisAsianUnemployed <- employmentdata$HC04_EST_VC16
employmentdata$BelowHighSchoolUnemployed <- employmentdata$HC04_EST_VC38
employmentdata$AboveBacholarUnemployed <- employmentdata$HC04_EST_VC41
employmentdata$PovertyUnemployed <- employmentdata$HC04_EST_VC31
#Only keep the columns needed
employmentdata <- employmentdata[c(2,6,10,244:251)]
```

####4. Process Income Dataset
* I used 2 out of 3 variables from the raw datasets:  
    + 1. __GEO.id2__:    2010 census data geoid10 code by census tract  
    + 2. __HD01_VD01__:  Average income  
```{r}
#Change the used columns into corresponding names
incomedata <- rename(incomedata, Geoid10 = GEO.id2)
incomedata <- rename(incomedata, Income = HD01_VD01)
#Only keep the columns needed
incomedata <- incomedata[c(2,4)]
```

####5. Combine All Three Datasets Processed
```{r}
#Join three datasets together;
censusdata <- full_join(populationdata, genderdata, by = "Geoid10")
censusdata <- full_join(censusdata, employmentdata, by = "Geoid10")
censusdata <- full_join(censusdata, incomedata, by = "Geoid10")
#Remove unprocessed datasets to free up memory
rm(genderdata, employmentdata, incomedata, genderdataURL, employmentdataURL, incomedataURL)
setwd("/Users/Pinnzhang/Desktop")
write.csv(censusdata, file = "NYC_2010_Census_Data_Other_Attributes.csv")
```

##### Footnote:
These three raw datasets were all downloaded from 2010 census dataset downloaded from American Factfinder, a website supported by American Census Bureau. 
URL:http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml  

* In order to make this RMD file reproducable, I downloaded the file and pushed it onto my github with an open access.   
    + a. __Gender Data__  
        URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinnnnnn/MAP_Spring_2016/master/2010_NYC_Age_and_Sex.csv  
    + b. __Employment Data__  
        URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinnnnnn/MAP_Spring_2016/master/2010_NYC_Employment_Data.csv  
    + c. __Income Data__  
        URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinnnnnn/MAP_Spring_2016/master/2010_NYC_Individual_Income.csv  
        
I replaced all of the "," in the raw datasets in Excel before I uploaded them to github. Otherwise, R regards "," as a seperator for columns when it reads the datasets.
